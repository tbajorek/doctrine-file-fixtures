## Configuration

Using configuration you can adapt the library to your requirements. It can be changed in file `config/packages/doctrine_file_fixtures.yml`.

There are available these configurations:
* _identifier_ - information about indentifier used in fixtures:
    * _name_ - identifier name used in fixture files;
    * _persisted_ - flag informing if identifier value from file should be set on entity model before saving it in database;
* _source_ - configuration for source of fixtures:
    * _directory_ - specify where fixture file(s) are located;
    * _file_extension_ - extension for the fixture file(s); all files have to have the same extension for the project;
    * _single_file_ - if extension which is used for single file is chosen, it determines name of the files with entity;
    * _names_type_ - specify which names (columns from database table or fields from entity class) are used in fixture file(s);
* _entity_page_size_ - determine size of cursor for exporting entities from database to fixtures; used for optimization;
* _strategy_ - choose if all fixtures will be imported as new entities or existing entities will be just updated; it uses identifiers from fixture file(s).

| Name                    | Type   | Possible values | Default value |
|-------------------------|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| identifier / name       | string | N/A             | id            |
| identifier / persistent | bool   | true, false     | false         |
| source / directory      | string | N/A             | Fixtures/     |
| source / file_extension | string | csv, xlsx, ...  | csv           |
| source / single_file    | string | N/A             | fixtures      |
| source / names_type     | string | column, field   | column        |
| entity_page_size        | int    | N/A             | 1000          |
| strategy                | string | insert, upsert  | insert        |

### Example configuration

Example config file can look like:
```yaml
doctrine_file_fixtures:
  identifier:
    name: id
  source:
    directory: fixtures/
    single_file: project_fixtures
    file_extension: xlsx
  strategy: upsert
```

This configuration above means that there should be directory `fixtures/` located in a main directory of project. It contains Excel file `project_fixtures.xlsx`. In the file identifiers are located in columns named `id`. It's value is saved in database (according to default value for identifier / persistent). Chosen strategy for loading fixtures allows to update existing entities and creates new one for non-existing.
