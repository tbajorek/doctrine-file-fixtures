## Fixture file formats
There are two implemented adapters for file formats:
* csv
* xlsx

### Adding own format
You can easily add your own format of fixture files. It's enough to implement the following interface `\Tbajorek\DoctrineFileFixturesBundle\Model\FixtureFile\FixtureFileInterface`:
```php
<?php

namespace Tbajorek\DoctrineFileFixturesBundle\Model\FixtureFile;

use Tbajorek\DoctrineFileFixturesBundle\Model\Data\Fixture;
use Tbajorek\DoctrineFileFixturesBundle\Model\FixturesException;

interface FixtureFileInterface
{
    /**
     * Initialize fixture file and open it
     * 
     * @param string $fileName
     * @param string $className
     * @throws FixturesException
     */
    public function init(string $fileName, string $className): void;

    /**
     * Load next fixture from file and return it. If there is no more fixtures, return null.
     *
     * @return Fixture|null
     */
    public function loadNextFixture(): ?Fixture;

    /**
     * Save the file with data passed in argument
     *
     * @param Fixture[] $data
     */
    public function save(array $data): void;

    /**
     * Remain the file but make it empty
     */
    public function clean(): void;

    /**
     * Close the opened file
     */
    public function close(): void;
}
```

Then you have to add it to extension map. It's an array passed to service `tbajorek.doctrine_file_fixture.fixture_file_factory` in argument `$extensionMapping`. Keys of the array are file extensions and values are services known in DI which implement adapter interface, eg.:
```yaml
tbajorek.doctrine_file_fixture.fixture_file_factory:
    arguments:
      $extensionMapping:
        xml: MyProject\Fixtures\Model\FixtureFile\Adapter\Xml
```

Beside this you have to add the extension to fixture file provider map. It's described in the next chapter. There is no default resolver, so you have to determine it for all new file extensions.

## Fixture file resolving
Fixtures can be mapped to files in any way. There are two already implemented approaches:
* **single file** - all fixtures are stored in one file; file name is set in configuration;
* **fixture per file** - every fixture is stored in own file; file name is equal to table name.

### Adding own resolver
You can add own resolver to map your entities in a way you want just by implementing this interface `\Tbajorek\DoctrineFileFixturesBundle\Model\FixtureFile\FixtureFileResolverInterface`:
```php
<?php

namespace Tbajorek\DoctrineFileFixturesBundle\Model\FixtureFile;

interface FixtureFileResolverInterface
{
    /**
     * Return path to file where fixtures for the given entity are stored
     * 
     * @param string $className
     * @return string
     */
    public function resolve(string $className): string;
}
```
and register it as it's shown in next chapter.

### Adding resolver for file extension
To add resolver for a concrete file extension you have to pass it to service `tbajorek.doctrine_file_fixture.fixture_file_factory` as `$extensionMapping` argument. It's an array with file extension as key and service as value. so the value has to be known for DI, eg.:
```yaml
tbajorek.doctrine_file_fixture.resolver_file_factory:
    arguments:
      $extensionMapping:
        xml: Tbajorek\DoctrineFileFixturesBundle\Model\FixtureFile\Resolver\SingleFileResolver
```
**Warning!** Changing resolvers for implemented file adapters without reimplementation will cause errors. However, you can add your own adapter and then you can add resolver for it.
